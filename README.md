## NES ROM Development
Currently learning how to develop for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and learning assembly for the 6502 processor.
I'm spliting off into different branches to test each individual part for the Nintendo Entertainment System and tackling each one down.

**THIS REPOSITORY IS EXPERIMENTAL AND FOR PERSONAL EDUCATION FOR PROGRAMMING, I WILL MAKE AND/OR USE VERY HACKISH WAYS OF PROGRAMING WITH POOR PERFORMANCE OR UNUSUAL WORKAROUNDS. IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK IS WRONG OR COULD BE IMPROVED ON, PLEASE LET ME KNOW I WILL GLADLY TAKE YOUR ADVICE!**

## Software/Files used

### Compiler

**files:** asminc, bin, cfg, and include came from [cc65](https://www.cc65.org/).

## Program Files

The files **NES.C**, **Blocken.h**, **Compile.bat**, and **makefile.bat** were coded by me. Feel free to use them for any NES programming project for either references or tweaking the code to better suit your need. Just don't sell these to people and don't claim that you made the C file even when modified, at least give some credit *(If you want to)*.

### Script Editor

All **C** was coded using [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
